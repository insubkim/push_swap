checker 프로그램

-스택을 인자로 받는다.
Write a program named checker that takes as an argument the stack a formatted
as a list of integers. The first argument should be at the top of the stack (be careful
about the order). If no argument is given, it stops and displays nothing.

-표준입력으로 명령 받고, 스택에서 명령 실행
• It will then wait and read instructions on the standard input, each instruction will
be followed by ’\n’. Once all the instructions have been read, the program has to
execute them on the stack received as an argument.

-맞으면 ok 표시
• If after executing those instructions, the stack a is actually sorted and the stack b
is empty, then the program must display "OK" followed by a ’\n’ on the standard
output.

-틀리면 ko 표시
• In every other case, it must display "KO" followed by a ’\n’ on the standard output.

-에러 처리

• In case of error, you must display "Error" followed by a ’\n’ on the standard error. 
Errors include for example: some arguments are not integers, 
some arguments are bigger than an integer, there are duplicates, 
an instruction doesn’t exist and/or is incorrectly formatted.

-실행해야되는 명령
    스왑, 푸시, 로테이트, 역로테이트, 동시스왑, 동시 로테이트, 동시 역로테이트
sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
    Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
    Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
ss : sa and sb at the same time.
pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
    Do nothing if b is empty.
pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
    Do nothing if a is empty.
ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.
    The first element becomes the last one.
rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.
    The first element becomes the last one.
rr : ra and rb at the same time.
rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.
    The last element becomes the first one.
rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.
    The last element becomes the first one.
rrr : rra and rrb at the same time
